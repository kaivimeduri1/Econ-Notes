The Economic Perspective
        This is a viewpoint that envisions individuals and institutions (aka companies and firms etc) into making rational decisions by comparing the marginal benefits and marginal costs and this consists of scarcity and choice, opportunity cost, purposeful behavior to increase utility, and marginal analysis. (textbook definitions).
        Scarcity and choice is when you have goods but are limited. Scarcity and choice is when resources are very rare and choices must be made. 
        Opportunity cost means a cost that you are taking to do something ie. going to class makes you lose sleep and it can make you work less hours at a job etc. Time is money, you lean towards things that help your benefit.
        Purposeful behavior to increase utility means something that you are doing for your own happiness such as working hard, such as being irrationally rational to help yourself be happy. This is rational self-interest and this is individuals and utility. Firms and profit - firms are made to make money and the opposite is such as non-profit companies which are not for a self benefit.
        Marginal analysis is the last thing and this is the weighing of pros and cons. This is something that we do everyday without knowing and the marginal means extra or additional benefits or less cost benefits for each individual person. Such as a second glass of water after running, or more glasses as they aren't as refreshing as that first one. Marginal benefit = Marginal cost.

Theories, Principles, and Models
        The scientific method. This is when you run data, find sources, make hypotheses,  make observations, test it, make modifications, and all scientific worlds but works for economics as well. Economics is not just money, it's 99% other things to solve world issues. 

Economic principles 
        Other-Things-Equal-Assumptions: This is the assumption that factors other than those being considered do not change. When things reduce, demand rises. 

Micro and Macro Economics
        Micro means the study of the individual consumer, firm, and market. How inflation affects the individual person. 
        Macro means the study of the entire economy or a major aggregate of the economy. This is such as speaking of inflation as a whole, stock market, etc. Aggregate demand and supply model which show decrease and increase of the entire market short run and long run. Short run means next 3 months, long run is next year or next few years ( a prediction based on theory) 

Positive and Normative Economics
        Positive is factual statements such as statistics and proven words.
        Normative is when stuff is involved by judgements of people such as people on social media.

The Economizing Problem 
        This is limited income and unlimited wants. The  budget line is attainable and unattainable combinations. If you’re inside the budget line then it is attainable, and if you’re outside, then it is harder to gain which leads to trade-offs and opportunity costs i.e. making risks for greater gains. 

A Consumer's Budget Line
        When income is $120 and each paperback is 20, you can get 6 books because they are attainable. In the future, you have $120 and each book is $10 and you can get 12 books. In this way, your attainable reach is reduced. 

Global Perspectives
        GDP and this means the value of the economy. This is how big of a slice of the economy is needed for a country to sustain. 

Society’s Economizing Problem
        4 categories of economic resources 
        Land: All resources that are natural and used in the production process. Such as when a pizza factory exists, you need dough, ingredients, spices, etc. Nature.
        Labor: The physical actions and mental activities that many people contribute to production. Workers. In class - Students, teacher. 
        Capital: Any physical machinery. All manufactured goods that aid to production and this is also investment. Machinery. In class - chairs, room, projector. 
        Entrepreneur: The leader of it all, he needs all the things from the top 3 categories and he hosts the entire product and it is a special human resource that isn’t labor at all. 

Functions of Entrepreneurs 
      To employ the other factors of production

Scarcity, opportunity cost, trade-offs 
         Backbone of Economics

Factors of Production
        Entrepreneur is the guy that runs the whole operation that has Land, Labor, and Capital

Production Possibility Model
        This is an economic model that shows different combos of 2 goods that an economy can produce. 
        There are assumptions such as full employment, fixed resources, fixed technology, and 2 goods which are consumer goods and capital. 
        These are linear possibilities based on the resources.
        Think about the pizza profits and robots production, and so the more robots there are, the more consumption of pizzas. 

        In the graph above, the area below the curve is attainable but inefficient, and unattainable is above the curve and its efficient 

Increasing opportunity costs
        The law of increasing opportunity costs: As there are more of a particular good, its marginal opportunity cost increases
        Production possibilities curve: the Concave shape and the economic rationale
        So the more of a good is being used, the value raises

Unemployment, growth, and future
        Lots of concern about employee productivity as there are hybrid work systems in place after Covid-19
        Teslas are easy to drive as they self drive, AI can do work for you, laptops 

International Trade
        Trade is cheaper with foreign countries. Increase in production possibilities
        Specialization is important when careers are fluctuating 

The Marginal Starbucks
        Starbucks is massive international company by using marginal benefit/ marginal cost analysis by using many key decisions including, ranking and selecting new locations, determining local saturation, setting the menu to everyone.

The 5 Fundamental Questions
  - What will be produced?
      - Goods and services because they create a profit. This means there is customer sovereignty which means there are “dollar votes” which allows customers to indicate which goods and services should be produced as well as determine which products and industries survive or fail. Humans signal to higher people to make products that are in high demand.
  - How will goods be produced?
      - This is to make prices of technology and resources cheap so people won’t be sressed about buying things. 
  - Who will get output?
      - This is the topic of who has the ability to pay for something as well as who has the willingness to pay to get the product.
      - This is being given the option to pay due to income and demand. 
  - How will the system change?
      - This is when there are obvious changes that occur in the consumers tastes. 
      - Leads to changes in technology and changes in resource prices.
  - How will the system progress?
      - Technological advances such as creative destruction because it is the hypothesis that the creation of new products and production models destroy the markey power of the existing monopolies.
      - This leads to capital accumulation.
